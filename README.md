Books Tracker is a native Android application developed in Java that enables users to manage personal libraries and track reading habits via Firebase Firestore and Authentication. The app integrates Retrofit for asynchronous REST API consumption to fetch literary quotes and utilizes Volley for real-time price comparisons through the Google Books API. To ensure robust connectivity, I implemented a custom Network Security Configuration to handle complex SSL/TLS handshake challenges and chain validation. The user interface follows Material Design principles, featuring a dynamic social feed, interactive navigation, and automated data entry via ISBN barcode scanning.
